Whispers of the Morning

The sun peeks over hills of gold,
A story of the dawn unfolds.
The breeze hums softly through the trees,
A gentle whisper, natureâ€™s ease.

Each leaf that dances in the light,
Each bird that takes its morning flight,
Reminds us, in the quiet and calm,
Life itself is a soothing balm.
